Write a solution to find invalid tweets. A tweet is considered invalid if it meets any of the following criteria:

It exceeds 140 characters in length.
It has more than 3 mentions.
It includes more than 3 hashtags.
Return the result table ordered by tweet_id in ascending order.

SELECT tweet_id, tweet_text
FROM tweets
WHERE
    LENGTH(tweet_text) > 140 OR
    (LENGTH(tweet_text) - LENGTH(REPLACE(tweet_text, '@', ''))) > 3 OR
    (LENGTH(tweet_text) - LENGTH(REPLACE(tweet_text, '#', ''))) > 3
ORDER BY tweet_id ASC;
REPLACE(tweet_text, '@', ''): This function removes all occurrences of the @ character from the tweet_text.
LENGTH(REPLACE(tweet_text, '@', '')): This calculates the length of the tweet text after all @ characters have been removed.
LENGTH(tweet_text) - LENGTH(REPLACE(tweet_text, '@', '')): This calculates the difference in length before and after removing the @ characters. This difference represents the number of @ characters (mentions) in the tweet.
> 3: This condition checks if there are more than 3 mentions.
REPLACE(tweet_text, '#', ''): This function removes all occurrences of the # character from the tweet_text.
LENGTH(REPLACE(tweet_text, '#', '')): This calculates the length of the tweet text after all # characters have been removed.
LENGTH(tweet_text) - LENGTH(REPLACE(tweet_text, '#', '')): This calculates the difference in length before and after removing the # characters. This difference represents the number of # characters (hashtags) in the tweet.
> 3: This condition checks if there are more than 3 hashtags.

Table: Departments

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the id of each department of a university.


Table: Students

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| department_id | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the id of each student at a university and the id of the department he/she studies at.


Find the id and the name of all students who are enrolled in departments that no longer exist.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

solution:
select s.id, s.name from students s
where
department_id not in
(select id from departments);

using Joins:
select s.id, s.name from students s
left joinCertainly! Let's dive deeper into the logic of the query that finds students enrolled in departments that no longer exist using the LEFT JOIN method.

Query
sql
Copy code
SELECT s.id, s.name
FROM Students s
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON s.department_id = d.id
WHERE d.id IS NULL;
Explanation
1. LEFT JOIN
Syntax: LEFT JOIN is used to combine rows from two tables, based on a related column between them. A LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table (Students), and the matched rows from the right table (Departments). If there is no match, the result is NULL on the side of the right table.
Usage in Query: LEFT JOIN Departments d ON s.department_id = d.id
2. Filtering Non-Existent Departments
Condition: WHERE d.id IS NULL
Explanation: After the LEFT JOIN, rows from the Students table that do not have a corresponding id in the Departments table will have NULL in the Departments columns. The WHERE d.id IS NULL condition filters these rows, identifying students whose department_id does not match any existing id in the Departments table.
Detailed Steps with Example
Let's go through an example step by step.

Tables
Departments Table:

id	name
1	Engineering
2	Arts
3	Science
Students Table:

id	name	department_id
1	Alice	1
2	Bob	2
3	Charlie	4
4	David	NULL
5	Eve	3
Step-by-Step Execution
Perform LEFT JOIN:

Join the Students table with the Departments table on department_id = id.
s.id	s.name	s.department_id	d.id	d.name
1	Alice	1	1	Engineering
2	Bob	2	2	Arts
3	Charlie	4	NULL	NULL
4	David	NULL	NULL	NULL
5	Eve	3	3	Science
Notice how Charlie and David have NULL in the d.id and d.name columns because there is no matching id in the Departments table for department_id 4, and David has a NULL department_id.
Filter Rows with d.id IS NULL:

Apply the WHERE d.id IS NULL condition to keep only rows where there is no corresponding department.
s.id	s.name	s.department_id	d.id	d.name
3	Charlie	4	NULL	NULL
4	David	NULL	NULL	NULL
Select Required Columns:

Select the s.id and s.name columns for the final result.
id	name
3	Charlie
4	David
Summary
LEFT JOIN ensures all students are included in the result, regardless of whether they are enrolled in an existing department.
WHERE d.id IS NULL filters out students whose departments do not exist (i.e., departments that are not present in the Departments table).
The final result includes only the students who are enrolled in non-existent departments, identified by their IDs and names.
departments d
on s.department_id = d.id
where d.id is NULL;


SELECT s.id, s.name
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN Departments d ON s.department_id != d.id;

ChatGPT
Using an INNER JOIN with the condition s.department_id != d.id would not achieve the desired result and would lead to incorrect results. Let's analyze why this is the case.

INNER JOIN with s.department_id != d.id
When you write an INNER JOIN with the condition s.department_id != d.id, the query is attempting to match rows where the department_id in the Students table is not equal to any id in the Departments table. This does not make logical sense for identifying non-existent departments because it will result in a Cartesian product minus the matching rows, leading to irrelevant and excessive results.

Query
sql
Copy code
SELECT s.id, s.name
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN Departments d ON s.department_id != d.id;
Why It Doesn't Work
Unintended Cartesian Product: This condition s.department_id != d.id will generate many unintended combinations, as it will match every student with every department that does not match their department_id. This results in a large number of irrelevant rows.
Irrelevant Data: The result will include students multiple times with various departments, leading to an incorrect and inflated result set.
Example with INNER JOIN and != Condition
Given the same data:

Departments Table:

id	name
1	Engineering
2	Arts
3	Science
Students Table:

id	name	department_id
1	Alice	1
2	Bob	2
3	Charlie	4
4	David	NULL
5	Eve	3
Using the query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT s.id, s.name
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN Departments d ON s.department_id != d.id;
This will produce a result set where each student is matched with every department that is not their own:

s.id	s.name
1	Alice
1	Alice
2	Bob
2	Bob
3	Charlie
3	Charlie
3	Charlie
4	David
4	David
4	David
5	Eve
5	Eve
Correct Approach: LEFT JOIN with WHERE d.id IS NULL
The correct approach remains using a LEFT JOIN with a WHERE clause to filter out the rows where there is no matching department. This accurately captures students whose department_id does not exist in the Departments table.

Correct Query
sql
Copy code
SELECT s.id, s.name
FROM Students s
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON s.department_id = d.id
WHERE d.id IS NULL;
Explanation of Correct Query
LEFT JOIN: Ensures that all students are included in the result, regardless of whether there is a matching row in the Departments table.
WHERE d.id IS NULL: Filters the result to include only rows where there is no matching department, identifying students whose department_id does not exist in the Departments table.
Summary
Using INNER JOIN with s.department_id != d.id generates irrelevant results and does not solve the problem.
The correct approach is to use LEFT JOIN and filter with WHERE d.id IS NULL to accurately find students enrolled in departments that no longer exist.
This method ensures that the result includes only the students who do not have a matching department in the Departments table, providing the correct answer to the problem.
